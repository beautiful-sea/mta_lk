	<title>Buying a Vehicle</title>
	<text>To by a vehicle head over to Grotti in Richman. They have every vehicle you could ever imagine, all brand new. If a new car from Grotti stretching your budget a bit tight, you could place an ad for a second hand car. It might not be the right colour you want and it might not have that fresh off the production line smell but atleast it's cheaper. For speciality vehicles that can't be bought from Grotti, you will need to contact an admin with the model of the vehicle and a reason why you want it.
